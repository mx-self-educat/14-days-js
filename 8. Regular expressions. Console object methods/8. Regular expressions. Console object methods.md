# ðŸ“˜ Day 12

## Regular Expressions

A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data. A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types. To use RegExp in JavaScript either we use RegExp constructor or we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. We can create a pattern in two ways.

To declare a string we use a single quote, double quote a backtick to declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y.

### RegExp parameters

A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag.

#### Pattern

A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which some sort of similarity. For instance the word spam in an email could be a pattern we are interested to look for in an email or a phone number format number might be our interest to look for.

#### Flags

Flags are optional parameters in a regular expression which determine the type of searching. Let see some of the flags:

- g:is a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text
- i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase)
- m: multiline

### Creating a pattern with RegExp Constructor

Declaring regular expression without global flag and case insensitive flag.

```js
// without flag
let pattern = 'love'
let regEx = new RegExp(pattern)
```

Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag.

```js
let pattern = 'love'
let flag = 'gi'
let regEx = new RegExp(pattern, flag)
```

Declaring a regex pattern using RegExp object. Writing the pattern and the flag inside the RegExp constructor

```js
let regEx = new RegExp('love','gi')
```

### Creating a pattern without RegExp Constructor

Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag.

```js
let regEx= /love/gi
```

The above regular expression is the same as the one which we created with RegExp constructor

```js
let regEx= new RegExp('love','gi')
```

### RegExpp Object Methods

Let see some of RegExp methods

#### Testing for  a match

*test()*:Tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false.

```js
const str = 'I love JavaScript'
const pattern = /love/
const result = pattern.test(str)
console.log(result)
```

```sh
true
```

#### Array containing all of the match

*match()*:Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found.
If we do not use a global flag, match() returns an array containing the pattern, index, input and group.

```js
const str = 'I love JavaScript'
const pattern = /love/
const result = str.match(pattern)
console.log(result)
```

```sh
["love", index: 2, input: "I love JavaScript", groups: undefined]
```

```js
const str = 'I love JavaScript'
const pattern = /love/g
const result = str.match(pattern)
console.log(result)
```

```sh
["love"]
```

*search()*: Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.

```js
const str = 'I love JavaScript'
const pattern = /love/g
const result = str.search(pattern)
console.log(result)
```

```sh
2
```

#### Replacing a substring

*replace()*: Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.

```js
const txt = 'Python is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created.\
I recommend python for a first programming language'

matchReplaced = txt.replace(/Python|python/, 'JavaScript')
console.log(matchReplaced)
```

```sh
JavaScript is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created.I recommend python for a first programming language
```

```js
const txt = 'Python is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created.\
I recommend python for a first programming language'

matchReplaced = txt.replace(/Python|python/g, 'JavaScript')
console.log(matchReplaced)
```

```sh
JavaScript is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created.I recommend JavaScript for a first programming language
```

```js
const txt = 'Python is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created.\
I recommend python for a first programming language'

matchReplaced = txt.replace(/Python/gi, 'JavaScript')
console.log(matchReplaced)
```

```sh
JavaScript is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created.I recommend JavaScript for a first programming language
```

```js

const txt = '%I a%m te%%a%%che%r% a%n%d %% I l%o%ve te%ach%ing.\
T%he%re i%s n%o%th%ing as m%ore r%ewarding a%s e%duc%at%i%ng a%n%d e%m%p%ow%er%ing \
p%e%o%ple.\
I fo%und te%a%ching m%ore i%n%t%er%%es%ting t%h%an any other %jobs.\
D%o%es thi%s m%ot%iv%a%te %y%o%u to b%e a t%e%a%cher.'

matches = txt.replace(/%/g, '')
console.log(matches)  
```

```sh

![Regular Expression cheat sheet](../images/regex.png)

Let's use example to clarify the above meta characters

### Square Bracket

Let's use square bracket to include lower and upper case

```js
const pattern = '[Aa]pple' // this square bracket mean either A or a
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says an apple a day a doctor way has been replaced by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far away. '
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  
```

```sh
["Apple", index: 0, input: "Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says anâ€¦by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far away. ", groups: undefined]

```

```js
const pattern = /[Aa]pple/g // this square bracket mean either A or a
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says an apple a day a doctor way has been replaced by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far away. '
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  
```

```sh
["Apple", "apple"]
```

If we want to look for the banana, we write the pattern as follows:

```js
const pattern = /[Aa]pple|[Bb]anana/g // this square bracket mean either A or a
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says an apple a day a doctor way has been replaced by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far away. Banana is easy to eat too.'
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  
```

```sh
["Apple", "banana", "apple", "banana", "Banana"]
```

Using the square bracket and or operator , we manage to extract Apple, apple, Banana and banana.

### Escape character(\\) in RegExp

```js
const pattern = /\d/g  // d is a special character which means digits
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in January 12,  2020.'
const matches = txt. match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  // ["1", "2", "2", "0", "2", "0"], this is not what we want
```

```js
const pattern = /\d+/g  // d is a special character which means digits
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in January 12,  2020.'
const matches = txt. match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  // ["12", "2020"], this is not what we want
```

### One or more times(+)

```js
const pattern = /\d+/g  // d is a special character which means digits
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in January 12,  2020.'
const matches = txt. match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ["12", "2020"], this is not what we want
```

### Period(.)

```js
const pattern = /[a]./g  // this square bracket means a and . means any character except new line
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits'
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  // ["an", "an", "an", "a ", "ar"]
```

```js
const pattern = /[a].+/g  // . any character, + any character one or more times 
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits'
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  // ['and banana are fruits']
```

### Zero or more times(*)

Zero or many times. The pattern could may not occur or it can occur many times.

```js

const pattern = /[a].*/g  //. any character, + any character one or more times 
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits'
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  // ['and banana are fruits']

```

### Zero or one times(?)

Zero or one times. The pattern could may not occur or it may occur once.

```js
const txt = 'I am not sure if there is a convention how to write the word e-mail.\
Some people write it email others may write it as Email or E-mail.'
const pattern = /[Ee]-?mail/g  // ? means optional
matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)  // ["e-mail", "email", "Email", "E-mail"]

```

### Quantifier in RegExp

We can specify the length of the substring we look for in a text, using a curly bracket. Lets imagine, we are interested in substring that their length are 4 characters

```js
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /\d{4}/g  // exactly four times
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ['2019']
```

```js
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /\d{1,4}/g   // 1 to 4
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ['6', '2019']
```

### Cart ^

- Starts with
  
```js
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /^This/ // ^ means starts with
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ['This']
```

- Negation

```js
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /[^A-Za-z,. ]+/g  // ^ in set character means negation, not A to Z, not a to z, no space, no coma no period
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ["6", "2019"]
```

### Exact match

It should have ^ starting and $ which is an end.

```js
let pattern = /^[A-Z][a-z]{3,12}$/;
let name = 'Asabeneh';
let result = pattern.test(name)

console.log(result) // true
```

# Day 13

## Console Object Methods

In this section, we will cover about console and console object methods. Absolute beginners usually do not know which to use: console.log(), document.write() or document.getElementById.

We use console object methods to show output on the browser console and we use document.write to show output on the browser document(view port). Both methods used only for testing and debugging purposes. The console method is the most popular testing and debugging tool on the browser. We use document.getElementById() when we like to interact with DOM try using JavaScript. We will cover DOM in another section.

In addition to the famous, console.log() method, the console provides other more methods methods.

### console.log()

We use console.log() to show output on the browser console. We can substitute values and also we can style the logging out put using %c.

- Showing output on browser console

```js
console.log('30 Days of JavaScript')
```

```sh
30 Days of JavaScript
```

- Substitution

```js
console.log('%d %s of JavaScript', 30, 'Days')
```

```sh
30 Days of JavaScript
```

- CSS

We can style logging message using css. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to see the result.

```js
console.log('%c30 Days Of JavaScript', 'color:green') // log output is green
console.log(
  '%c30 Days%c %cOf%c %cJavaScript%c',
  'color:green',
  '',
  'color:red',
  '',
  'color:yellow'
) // log output green red and yellow text
```

### console.warn()

We use console.warn() to give warning on browser. For instance to inform or warn deprecation of version of a package or bad practices. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to see warning messages.

```js
console.warn('This is a warning')
console.warn(
  'You are using React. Do not touch the DOM. Virtual DOM will take care of handling the DOM!'
)
console.warn('Warning is different from error')
```

### console.error()

The console.error() methods shows an error messages.

```js
console.error('This is an error message')
console.error('We all make mistakes')
```

### console.table()

The console.table() method display data as a table on the console. Displays tabular data as a table. The console.table() takes one required argument data, which must be an array or an object, and one additional optional parameter columns.

Let us first start with a simple array. The code below displays a table with two columns. An index column to display the index and value column to display the names

```js
const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Brook', 'David', 'John']
console.table(names)
```

Let us also check the result of an object. This creates table with two columns:an index column containing the keys and a value column contain the values of the object.

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Asabeneh',
  title: 'Programmer',
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  age: 250
}
console.table(user)
```

Check the rest of the examples by copying and paste on the browser console.

```js
const countries = [
  ['Finland', 'Helsinki'],
  ['Sweden', 'Stockholm'],
  ['Norway', 'Oslo']
]
console.table(countries)
```

```js
const users = [
  {
    name: 'Asabeneh',
    title: 'Programmer',
    country: 'Finland',
    city: 'Helsinki',
    age: 250
  },
  {
    name: 'Eyob',
    title: 'Teacher',
    country: 'Sweden',
    city: 'London',
    age: 25
  },
  {
    name: 'Asab',
    title: 'Instructor',
    country: 'Norway',
    city: 'Oslo',
    age: 22
  },
  {
    name: 'Matias',
    title: 'Developer',
    country: 'Denmark',
    city: 'Copenhagen',
    age: 28
  }
]
console.table(users)
```

### console.time()

Starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes. You give each timer a unique name, and may have up to 10,000 timers running on a given page. When you call console.timeEnd() with the same name, the browser will output the time, in milliseconds, that elapsed since the timer was started.

```js
const countries = [
  ['Finland', 'Helsinki'],
  ['Sweden', 'Stockholm'],
  ['Norway', 'Oslo']
]

console.time('Regular for loop')
for (let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
  console.log(countries[i][0], countries[i][1])
}
console.timeEnd('Regular for loop')

console.time('for of loop')
for (const [name, city] of countries) {
  console.log(name, city)
}
console.timeEnd('for of loop')

console.time('forEach loop')
countries.forEach(([name, city]) => {
  console.log(name, city)
})
console.timeEnd('forEach loop')
```

```sh
Finland Helsinki
Sweden Stockholm
Norway Oslo
Regular for loop: 0.34716796875ms
Finland Helsinki
Sweden Stockholm
Norway Oslo
for of loop: 0.26806640625ms
Finland Helsinki
Sweden Stockholm
Norway Oslo
forEach loop: 0.358154296875ms
```

According the above output the regular for loop is slower than for of or forEach loop.

### console.info()

It display information message on browser console.

```js
console.info('30 Days Of JavaScript challenge is trending on Github')
console.info('30 Days Of fullStack challenge might be released')
console.info('30 Days Of HTML and CSS challenge might be released')
```

### console.assert()

The console.assert() methods writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false. If the assertion is true, nothing happens. The first parameter is an assertion expression. If this expression is false, an Assertion failed error message will be displayed.

```js
console.assert(4 > 3, '4 is greater than 3') // no result
console.assert(3 > 4, '3 is not greater than 4') // Assertion failed: 3 is not greater than 4

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 1) {
  let errorMessage = `${i} is not even`
  console.log('the # is ' + i)
  console.assert(i % 2 === 0, { number: i, errorMessage: errorMessage })
}
```

### console.group()

The console.group() can help to group different log groups. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to the groups.

```js
const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Brook', 'David', 'John']
const countries = [
  ['Finland', 'Helsinki'],
  ['Sweden', 'Stockholm'],
  ['Norway', 'Oslo']
]
const user = {
  name: 'Asabeneh',
  title: 'Programmer',
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  age: 250
}
const users = [
  {
    name: 'Asabeneh',
    title: 'Programmer',
    country: 'Finland',
    city: 'Helsinki',
    age: 250
  },
  {
    name: 'Eyob',
    title: 'Teacher',
    country: 'Sweden',
    city: 'London',
    age: 25
  },
  {
    name: 'Asab',
    title: 'Instructor',
    country: 'Norway',
    city: 'Oslo',
    age: 22
  },
  {
    name: 'Matias',
    title: 'Developer',
    country: 'Denmark',
    city: 'Copenhagen',
    age: 28
  }
]

console.group('Names')
console.log(names)
console.groupEnd()

console.group('Countries')
console.log(countries)
console.groupEnd()

console.group('Users')
console.log(user)
console.log(users)
console.groupEnd()
```

### console.count()

It prints the number of time this console.count() is called. It takes a string label parameter. It is very helpful to count the number of times a function is called. In the following example, the console.count() method will run three times

```js
const func = () => {
  console.count('Function has been called')
}
func()
func()
func()
```

```sh
Function has been called: 1
Function has been called: 2
Function has been called: 3
```

### console.clear()

The console.clear() cleans the browser console.
