# Day 14

## Error Handling

JavaScript is a loosely-typed language. Some times you will get a runtime error when you try to access an undefined variable or call undefined function etc.

JavaScript similar to python or Java provides an error-handling mechanism to catch runtime errors using try-catch-finally block.

```js
try {
  // code that may throw an error
} catch (err) {
  // code to be executed if an error occurs
} finally {
  // code to be executed regardless of an error occurs or not
}
```

**try**: wrap suspicious code that may throw an error in try block.The try statement allows us to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

**catch**: write code to do something in catch block when an error occurs. The catch block can have parameters that will give you error information. Catch block is used to log an error or display specific messages to the user.

**finally**: finally block will always be executed regardless of the occurrence of an error. The finally block can be used to complete the remaining task or reset variables that might have changed before error occurred in try block.

**Example:**

```js
try {
  let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
  let fullName = fistName + ' ' + lastName
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err)
}
```

```sh
ReferenceError: fistName is not defined
    at <anonymous>:4:20
```

```js
try {
  let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
  let fullName = fistName + ' ' + lastName
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err) // we can use console.log() or console.error()
} finally {
  console.log('In any case I will be executed')
}
```

```sh
ReferenceError: fistName is not defined
    at <anonymous>:4:20
In any case it  will be executed
```

The catch block take a parameter. It is common to pass e, err or error as a parameter to the catch block. This parameter is an object and it has name and message keys. Lets use the name and message.

```js
try {
  let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
  let fullName = fistName + ' ' + lastName
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Name of the error', err.name)
  console.log('Error message', err.message)
} finally {
  console.log('In any case I will be executed')
}
```

```sh
Name of the error ReferenceError
Error message fistName is not defined
In any case I will be executed
```

throw: the throw statement allows us to create a custom error. We can through a string, number, boolean or an object. Use the throw statement to throw an exception. When you throw an exception, expression specifies the value of the exception. Each of the following throws an exception:

```js
throw 'Error2' // generates an exception with a string value
throw 42 // generates an exception with the value 42
throw true // generates an exception with the value true
throw new Error('Required') // generates an error object with the message of Required
```

```js
const throwErroExampleFun = () => {
  let message
  let x = prompt('Enter a number: ')
  try {
    if (x == '') throw 'empty'
    if (isNaN(x)) throw 'not a number'
    x = Number(x)
    if (x < 5) throw 'too low'
    if (x > 10) throw 'too high'
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
throwErroExampleFun()
```

### Error Types

- ReferenceError: An illegal reference has occurred. A ReferenceError is thrown if we use a variable that has not been declared.

```js
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

console.log(fullName)
```

```sh
Uncaught ReferenceError: lastName is not defined
    at <anonymous>:2:35
```

- SyntaxError: A syntax error has occurred

```js
let square = 2 x 2
console.log(square)

console.log('Hello, world")
```

```sh
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
```

- TypeError: A type error has occurred

```js
let num = 10
console.log(num.toLowerCase())
```

```sh
Uncaught TypeError: num.toLowerCase is not a function
    at <anonymous>:2:17
```

These are some of the common error you may face when you write a code. Understanding errors can help you to know what mistakes you made and it will help you to debug your code fast.

ðŸŒ• You are flawless. Now, you knew how to handle errors and you can write robust application which handle unexpected user inputs. You have just completed day 14 challenges and you are 14 steps a head in to your way to greatness. Now do some exercises for your brain and for your muscle.

# Day 15

## Classes

JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. Everything in JavScript is an object, with its properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.

Once we create a class we can create object from it whenever we want. Creating an object from a class is called class instantiation.

In the object section, we saw how to create an object literal. Object literal is a singleton. If we want to get a similar object , we have to write it. However, class allows to create many objects. This helps to reduce amount of code and repetition of code.

### Defining a classes

To define a class in JavaScript we need the keyword _class_ , the name of a class in **CamelCase** and block code(two curly brackets). Let us create a class name Person.

```sh
// syntax
class ClassName {
    //  code goes here
}

```

**Example:**

```js
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
```

We have created an Person class but it does not have any thing inside.

### Class Instantiation

Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword _new_ and we call the name of the class after the word new.

Let us create a dog object from our Person class.

```js
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
const person = new Person()
console.log(person)
```

```sh
PersonÂ {}
```

As you can see, we have created a person object. Since the class did not have any properties yet the object is also empty.

Let use the class constructor to pass different properties for the class.

### Class Constructor

The constructor is a builtin function which allows as to create a blueprint for our object. The constructor function starts with a keyword constructor followed by a parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis we pass the properties of the object as parameter. We use the _this_ keyword to attach the constructor parameters with the class.

The following Person class constructor has firstName and lastName property. These properties are attached to the Person class using _this_ keyword. _This_ refers to the class itself.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log(this) // Check the output from here
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person = new Person()

console.log(person)
```

```sh
PersonÂ {firstName: undefined, lastName}
```

All the keys of the object are undefined. When ever we instantiate we should pass the value of the properties. Let us pass value at this time when we instantiate the class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')

console.log(person1)
```

```sh
PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
```

As we have stated at the very beginning that once we create a class we can create many object using the class. Now, let us create many person objects using the Person class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log(this) // Check the output from here
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle')
const person3 = new Person('Abraham', 'Yetayeh')

console.log(person1)
console.log(person2)
console.log(person3)
```

```sh
PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
PersonÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle"}
PersonÂ {firstName: "Abraham", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
```

Using the class Person we created three persons object. As you can see our class did not many properties let us add more properties to the class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    console.log(this) // Check the output from here
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')

console.log(person1)
```

```sh
PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki"}
```

### Default values with constructor

The constructor function properties may have a default value like other regular functions.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(
    firstName = 'Asabeneh',
    lastName = 'Yetayeh',
    age = 250,
    country = 'Finland',
    city = 'Helsinki'
  ) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }
}

const person1 = new Person() // it will take the default values
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

console.log(person1)
console.log(person2)
```

```sh
PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki"}
PersonÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Espoo"}
```

### Class methods

The constructor inside a class is a builtin function which allow us to create a blueprint for the object. In a class we can create class methods. Methods are JavaScript functions inside the class. Let us create some class methods.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

console.log(person1.getFullName())
console.log(person2.getFullName())
```

```sh
Asabeneh Yetayeh
test.js:19 Lidiya Tekle
```

### Properties with initial value

When we create a class for some properties we may have an initial value. For instance if you are playing a game, you starting score will be zero. So, we may have a starting score or score which is zero. In other way, we may have an initial skill and we will acquire some skill after some time.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

console.log(person1.score)
console.log(person2.score)

console.log(person1.skills)
console.log(person2.skills)
```

```sh
0
0
[]
[]
```

A method could be regular method or a getter or a setter. Let us see, getter and setter.

### getter

The get method allow us to access value from the object. We write a get method using keyword _get_ followed by a function. Instead of accessing properties directly from the object we use getter to get the value. See the example bellow

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getscore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

console.log(person1.getScore) // We do not need parenthesis to call a getter method
console.log(person2.getScore)

console.log(person1.getSkills)
console.log(person2.getSkills)
```

```sh
0
0
[]
[]
```

### setter

The setter method allow us to modify the value of certain properties. We write a setter method using keyword _set_ followed by a function. See the example bellow.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }
  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

person1.setScore = 1
person1.setSkill = 'HTML'
person1.setSkill = 'CSS'
person1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

person2.setScore = 1
person2.setSkill = 'Planning'
person2.setSkill = 'Managing'
person2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(person1.score)
console.log(person2.score)

console.log(person1.skills)
console.log(person2.skills)
```

```sh
1
1
["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"]
["Planning", "Managing", "Organizing"]
```

Do not be puzzled by the difference between regular method and a getter. If you know how to make a regular method you are good. Let us add regular method called getPersonInfo in the Person class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }
  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`
    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. He lives ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')
const person3 = new Person('John', 'Doe', 50, 'Mars', 'Mars city')

person1.setScore = 1
person1.setSkill = 'HTML'
person1.setSkill = 'CSS'
person1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

person2.setScore = 1
person2.setSkill = 'Planning'
person2.setSkill = 'Managing'
person2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(person1.getScore)
console.log(person2.getScore)

console.log(person1.getSkills)
console.log(person2.getSkills)
console.log(person3.getSkills)

console.log(person1.getPersonInfo())
console.log(person2.getPersonInfo())
console.log(person3.getPersonInfo())
```

```sh
1
1
["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"]
["Planning", "Managing", "Organizing"]
[]
Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250. He lives Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Lidiya Tekle is 28. He lives Espoo, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing
John Doe is 50. He lives Mars city, Mars.
```

### Static method

The static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are not called on instances of the class. Instead, they are called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects. An example of static method is _Date.now()_. The _now_ method is called directly from the class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }
  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. He lives ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
  static favoriteSkill() {
    const skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python', 'Node']
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * skills.length)
    return skills[index]
  }
  static showDateTime() {
    let now = new Date()
    let year = now.getFullYear()
    let month = now.getMonth() + 1
    let date = now.getDate()
    let hours = now.getHours()
    let minutes = now.getMinutes()
    if (hours < 10) {
      hours = '0' + hours
    }
    if (minutes < 10) {
      minutes = '0' + minutes
    }

    let dateMonthYear = date + '.' + month + '.' + year
    let time = hours + ':' + minutes
    let fullTime = dateMonthYear + ' ' + time
    return fullTime
  }
}

console.log(Person.favoriteSkill())
console.log(Person.showDateTime())
```

```sh
Node
15.1.2020 23:56
```

The static methods are methods which can be used as utility functions.

## Inheritance

Using inheritance we can access all the properties and the methods of the parent class. This reduces repetition of code. If you remember, we have a Person parent class and we will create children from it. Our children class could be student, teach etc.

```js
// syntax
class ChildClassName extends {
 // code goes here
}
```

Let us create a Student child class from Person parent class.

```js
class Student extends Person {
  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
}

const s1 = new Student('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 'Finland', 250, 'Helsinki')
console.log(s1)
console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())
```

```sh
StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
I am a child of the person class
Asabeneh Yetayeh
StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
Asabeneh Yetayeh is Finland. He lives Helsinki, 250.
```

### Overriding methods

As you can see, we manage to access all the methods in the Person Class and we used it in the Student child class. We can customize the parent methods, we can add additional properties to a child class. If we want to customize, the methods and if we want to add extra properties, we need to use the constructor function the child class too. In side the constructor function we call the super() function to access all the properties from the parent class. The Person class didn't have gender but now let us give gender property for the child class, Student. If the same method name used in the child class, the parent method will be overridden.

```js
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city, gender) {
    super(firstName, lastName, age, country, city)
    this.gender = gender
  }

  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''
    let pronoun = this.gender == 'Male' ? 'He' : 'She'

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. ${pronoun} lives in ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
}

const s1 = new Student(
  'Asabeneh',
  'Yetayeh',
  250,
  'Finland',
  'Helsinki',
  'Male'
)
const s2 = new Student('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Helsinki', 'Female')
s1.setScore = 1
s1.setSkill = 'HTML'
s1.setSkill = 'CSS'
s1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

s2.setScore = 1
s2.setSkill = 'Planning'
s2.setSkill = 'Managing'
s2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(s1)

console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())

console.log(s2.saySomething())
console.log(s2.getFullName())
console.log(s2.getPersonInfo())
```

```sh
StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
StudentÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
I am a child of the person class
Asabeneh Yetayeh
StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250. He lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript
I am a child of the person class
Lidiya Tekle
StudentÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
Lidiya Tekle is 28. She lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing
```

Now, the getPersonInfo method has been overridden and it identifies if the person is male or female.
